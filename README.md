# CMPE544 - Assignment 1: Expectation Maximization and Classification

This repository contains the code and report for Assignment 1 of CMPE544 – Pattern Recognition at Boğaziçi University. The assignment focuses on implementing the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, as well as k-NN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Logistic Regression classifiers.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the project.
    *   `quickdraw/`: Contains the Quick Draw dataset (train\_images.npy, train\_labels.npy, test\_images.npy, test\_labels.npy).
    *   `dataset.npy`: Synthetic dataset for the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
*   `results/`: Contains the output of the analysis and EM algorithm.
    *   `analysis/`: Stores the LDA scatter plot, inter-class centroid distance heatmap, and intra/inter-class statistics.
    *   `em/`: Stores the plots generated by the EM algorithm (raw data scatter plot, clustering results, log-likelihood convergence).
*   `src/`: Contains the source code.
    *   `classification/`: Contains the code for image classification.
        *   `analysis.py`: Code for feature space investigation and visualization.
        *   `knn.py`: Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier.
        *   `logreg.py`: Implementation of Multinomial Logistic Regression.
        *   `nb.py`: Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier.
        *   `preprocessing.py`: Code for data loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
    *   `em/`: Contains the code for the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
        *   `gmm.py`: Implementation of the Gaussian Mixture Model and EM algorithm.
*   `run.py`: Main script to run the EM algorithm and classification tasks.
*   `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to install the following required packages. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Execute the run.py script:
```bash
python run.py
```

This script will:

* Run the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm on the synthetic dataset.
* Load the Quick Draw dataset.
* Extract features from the images.
* Train and evaluate the k-NN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression classifiers.
* Generate analysis plots and statistics in the results directory.
